## Recommended Mumble positional settings

* Set the "Minimum Volume" to 50 or 60% to make sure that you can install hear your friends at a distance.
* Set a "Maximum Distance" to around 50m to create a smooth transition for the volume to gradually lower as they move to prevent the volume dropping too fast.
